# ðŸŒŠ Ocean-Oxygen-Level-Prediction

Modeled oceanic oxygen levels based on environmental factors like depth, salinity, and temperature

Cleaned missing data, removed outliers using z-scores, and normalized features for better ML performance

Achieved RÂ² = 0.8222 and MAE = 0.52 with a Random Forest Regressor; depth was most important feature

Used cross-validation and visualization (scatterplots, time series, correlation matrices) to support conclusions

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Analyze environmental factors affecting oceanic oxygen concentration and predict oxygen levels using machine learning.

## ðŸ§  Approach
- Cleaned missing data and removed outliers
- Normalized features using StandardScaler
- Conducted EDA (correlation matrix, scatter plots, time series)
- Built and evaluated models:
  - Random Forest Regressor (RÂ² = 0.8222, MAE = 0.52)
  - Linear Regression (RÂ² = -0.62)
- Used cross-validation to improve generalization

## âœ… Findings
- Depth has the strongest inverse relationship with oxygen levels
- Random Forest handled non-linear features better than Linear Regression
- Further analysis needed on seasonal/geographic patterns
